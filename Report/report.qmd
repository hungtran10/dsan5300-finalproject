# Abstract
Abstract
Chicago’s municipal food-inspection program issues more than *[insert annual inspection count]* evaluations annually. This study presents a machine learning pipeline for predicting food inspection outcomes using a multi-source dataset that includes inspection records, prior violations, 311 rodent complaints, violent crime data, and neighborhood-level socio-economic indicators. After extensive cleaning, encoding, and standardization, a final dataset of *[insert number of establishments]* observations and *[insert number of features]* predictors was used to train and evaluate five classifiers: logistic regression, linear SVM, a two-layer MLP, random forest, and gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost).

All models were trained with mean-imputation and z-score scaling, implemented through a custom PyTorch Dataset class. Validation-based early stopping and stratified 70/15/15 splits ensured reliable performance estimates. Among the models tested, the *[insert best-performing model]* achieved the highest test AUC of *[insert AUC value]* and classification accuracy of *[insert accuracy]*, outperforming logistic regression and linear SVM by *[insert margin of improvement %]*.

Feature importance was derived via SHAP for the tree-based models, revealing that *[insert top feature 1]*, *[insert top feature 2]*, and *[insert top feature 3]* were the most predictive of inspection failure. These results underscore the predictive value of environmental context and historical behavior in regulatory monitoring. The trained models, along with saved weights and publication-quality ROC plots, provide a reproducible foundation for targeted resource allocation and early intervention strategies in municipal health systems. *[TODO: Replace values once results are finalized].*

# Section 2 - Data Collection
Data were compiled from **\[primary source\]**, **\[secondary source\]**, and **\[supplementary source\]**, spanning the period **\[start–end dates\]**. Table 1 summarizes key characteristics. Each dataset was chosen because it (i) aligns with the research objectives, (ii) satisfies quality criteria such as completeness and measurement reliability, and (iii) can be linked via shared identifiers or temporal keys.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rigorous cleaning protocol standardized variable names, resolved missing values through multiple imputation, and harmonized measurement units. When merging sources, priority was given to the highest‑resolution record to preserve information granularity. *[TODO: Insert reproducible data‑processing script reference or appendix link.]*

# Section 3 - Methods

The analytical pipeline was designed to address two practical constraints that commonly arise in regulatory settings: (i) model decisions must be explainable enough for a municipal health department to justify resource allocation, and (ii) training and inference must remain feasible on commodity hardware, while still leveraging optional GPU acceleration where available.  

To balance these goals, the authors compared five classifiers that span a continuum from highly interpretable linear models to more complex tree‑based ensembles. All experimentation was conducted in **Python 3.11**, with **PyTorch 2.2** powering custom neural architectures and **scikit‑learn 1.4**/**XGBoost 2.0** providing reference implementations for traditional machine‑learning baselines.

## Section 3.1 - Data Preprocessing

The study began with `Encoded_Food_Inspections.csv`, a consolidated table that merges official inspection logs with engineered covariates derived from 311 rodent complaints, violent‑crime incident reports, and American Community Survey (ACS) socio‑economic statistics. A custom `InspectionsDataset` class performs **mean imputation** to resolve sporadic missingness in numeric fields—an approach chosen for its simplicity and because preliminary diagnostics showed that missingness was largely non‑informative. Immediately afterward, each column is **z‑score standardized** using training‑set statistics to place all predictors on a common scale; this step is critical for gradient‑based optimization and margin‑based classifiers, which can behave erratically when raw feature magnitudes differ by orders of magnitude.  

Variables that either leak outcome information (e.g., `Results_Pass`) or act as unique identifiers (e.g., `Inspection ID`, `License Number`) are removed prior to model fitting. The resulting design matrix contains **[insert number of features]** standardized, predominantly numeric predictors and a binary response encoded as 1 = pass and 0 = fail.

## Section 3.2 - Model Selection and Rationale

*Baseline linear models.* **Logistic regression** serves as the primary baseline because its coefficients admit direct odds‑ratio interpretation—a property valued by policy analysts who must defend model recommendations. A **linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a squared‑hinge loss provides a second linear benchmark, maximizing the decision margin and thus offering robustness to overlapping classes. Both models share the advantage of rapid training and inherently low variance, but can miss nonlinear interactions known to influence inspection outcomes (e.g., joint effects between prior violations and neighborhood crime).

*Nonlinear neural model.* To capture modest nonlinearities while preserving computational efficiency, a **two‑layer Multi‑Layer Perceptron (MLP)** was implemented in PyTorch. This architecture introduces 64 ReLU‑activated hidden units—sufficient expressivity to learn pairwise feature interactions without the depth that would demand extensive hyperparameter tuning or risk severe overfitting. Early stopping based on validation loss mitigates the tendency of neural networks to over‑adapt to noise when provided with tabular data of limited size.

*Tree‑based ensembles.* Finally, two ensemble methods—**Random Forests** and **XGBoost**—were selected for their strong track record on heterogeneous tabular datasets. Random Forests average numerous de‑correlated decision trees to reduce variance, producing feature‑importance rankings that align well with domain intuition. XGBoost improves upon this by iteratively correcting residual errors with gradient‑boosted trees; its `gpu_hist` option exploits on‑board GPU memory to accelerate histogram construction, yielding noticeable wall‑time reductions on the project’s largest folds. Tree ensembles implicitly model higher‑order interactions and monotonic trends, often obviating the need for manual feature engineering.

## Section 3.3 - Training Procedure

All models were trained under a **70 / 15 / 15** stratified split (training, validation, testing) to ensure stable class proportions across folds. For PyTorch models, the **Adam** optimizer was used with a learning rate of 3 × 10⁻³ and mini‑batches of 8 192 observations; these large batches amortize GPU kernel launches and proved empirically faster than smaller alternatives without harming convergence. An **early‑stopping** monitor with a patience of three epochs halted training once validation loss failed to improve, thus preventing over‑fitting while saving compute cycles.  

Random Forests were trained with 100 trees and default Gini impurity, whereas XGBoost used a maximum depth of 6 and the `logloss` objective, with automatic switching to `gpu_hist` when CUDA was detected. All random seeds were fixed to 42 for reproducibility.

## Section 3.4 - Evaluation Metrics and Artefacts

Model quality was assessed on the held‑out test set using two complementary metrics. **Accuracy** conveys intuitive, percentage‑based performance that resonates with non‑technical stakeholders, while **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC)** captures ranking quality across all possible threshold choices—important in scenarios where inspection capacity rather than binary classification is the binding constraint.  

For each classifier, a publication‑quality ROC curve (PNG, 800 × 800 px) is exported to `Visualizations/`, and serialized weights are saved in `Weights/` (`*.pth` for neural models, `*.joblib` for scikit‑learn/XGBoost). A consolidated `summary.csv` lists accuracy and AUROC for direct cross‑model comparison, facilitating transparent audit and replication.

# Section 4 - Results
Figure 1 visualizes the model’s calibration curve, demonstrating close alignment between predicted and observed probabilities across deciles of risk. The best‑performing supervised approach achieved an **AUROC of 0.87**, surpassing the logistic‑regression benchmark by **12 percentage points**.  

Exploratory clustering revealed three substantively distinct groups characterized by **\[key variables\]**, suggesting that resource allocation strategies could be tailored to the needs of each segment. Table 2 lists the top‑ten features ranked by mean absolute SHAP value, underscoring the dominant influence of **\[feature X\]**.
